Recently, deep neural networks have been achieving breakthroughs in various major artificial intelligence tasks such as machine translation, image understanding, speech recognition, and so on. In these tasks, deep neural networks reached the level of an accuracy comparable to or even better than humans’ performance. 

The primary goal of the workshop is to bridge the gap by bringing together researchers from both machine learning and visual analytics fields, which allows us to push the boundary of deep learning. The workshop should provide an opportunity to discuss and explore ways to harmonize the power of automated techniques and exploratory nature of interactive visualization. We believe that hosting one of the workshops in this series at IEEE VIS will foster a more multi-disciplinary community of researchers to address the topics outlined below.

## Topics and Scopes

The technical scope of this workshop includes any kinds of fundamental techniques and visual analytic systems that can help stakeholders understand the inner workings of deep learning models and interact with them in user’s own manner. In detail, topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- User-adaptive approaches to deep neural networks
- Coupling of deep learning-based systems with interactive visualization
- Visualization to improve deep learning algorithms and models
- Coordinated visualizations for deep learning
- Systems, languages, and architectures for interactive deep learning
- Collaborative analysis of deep network networks
- Real-time visualization of streaming data handling in deep learning
- Visualization of uncertainty in deep neural networks
- Domain-specific applications of visual analysis of deep neural networks (e.g. retail, healthcare, government, etc.)
- Studies and evaluation of deep learning visualization techniques, systems, metrics, and benchmarks

We invite various kinds of papers such as (but not limited to): 

- Novel research papers
- Demo papers
- Work-in-progress papers
- Visionary papers (white papers)
- Position papers
